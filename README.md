## Functionality
Our platform tailors the user experience by considering their dietary restrictions and the time of day to offer a personalized meal plan for any specific mealtime.

## Development
I devised a method to analyze  meal options, ensuring each dish complies with the user's dietary needs. This involved creating a Python backend for web scraping and analysis, seamlessly communicating with a frontend built using JavaScript and HTML through AJAX and Flask.

## Hurdles
My challenges fell into two main categories: syntax and algorithms. Integrating JavaScript and Python, despite prior experience with both languages individually, posed a novel challenge. On the algorithmic side, while the default selection strategy was random within restrictions, implementing a machine learning model for improved caloric recommendations proved to be a time-intensive challenge.

## Achievements
I'm most proud of achieving a fully functional web application that successfully integrates frontend JavaScript with backend Python.

## Insights Gained
Through this project, I acquired various techniques for integrating frontend and backend systems, with Flask serving as a valuable tool in this integration process.
